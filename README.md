# VectorUGo-2
Enhanced game console with vector display

VectorUGo 2 is an evolution of the VectorUGo console. It uses the same hardware but its firmware has been improved to include a special version of the ZTH1 RISC CPU along with RAM and ROM. An OS for the VectorUGo 2 console has been developped to allow programming in Forth with special vector display routines (sprite creation/rotation/scaling/collision-detection, text display) and will be added to the ZTH1-Forth repository.
